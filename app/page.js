              Flora Feed is a project that combines two of my passions- nature and technology- to make life a 
              little bit easier! With Flora Feed, I can remotely check my basil plant&apos;s moisture levels to 
              determine whether or not it needs to be watered soon. I love applying technical solutions to practical 
              problems, so this has been a blast to make so far! Keep reading to learn about how this project works

                How does this project work?
              </h1>
              <p>
                Flora Feed can be broken down into a few different main components- software, hardware, and infrastructure. 
                Let&apos;s dive in!
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="text-xl">
                Hardware
              </h2>
              <p>
                Being a software engineer, I don&apos;t get to interact with hardware during my regular work as much as I 
                would like to, and this project was a great oportunity for me to branch out and explore this other side of 
                the tech world! The setup for this project is a bit rudamentary, but it gets the job done. I am using an 
                old Raspberry Pi 4 Model B that I&apos;ve had sitting around and I wired it up to a capacitive moisture 
                sensor via a breadboard.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div>
              <h2 className="text-xl">
                Software
              </h2>
              <p>
                To make this project possible, I wrote a quick Python script to read data from the moisture sensor mentioned 
                above, which is sent via an HTTP POST request to a Java (Spring Boot) backend that authenticates the request 
                and then persists the the moisture reading data in a MySQL database. To display the info, the front-end (what 
                you are looking at right now) is built using Next.js and Tailwind CSS! I am planning to use a 
                microservice-focused architecture to enable scalability, optimization, and fault tolerance on this project as 
                it expands. This will also help me easily swap out service implementations whenever needed.

              <p>
                To really bring this project to life, I wanted to make this project available to the public! All of the 
                components are hosted on a Digital Ocean droplet.
